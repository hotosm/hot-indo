[site]: http://geotribu.net/applications/baselayers/index.php

###*ITO World###
[ITO World Ltd] provides two useful tools (you need to subscribe):
1. OSM Mapper: A program that allows you to monitor edits and changes across certain geographical areas. Providing global coverage, OSM Mapper reveals mapping contributions in local areas and is updated daily from the OpenStreetMap feed.
2. OSM Analysis: This program compares OpenStreetMap data to the Ordinance Survey's OS Locator data. Basically, it calculates the percentage of missing roads, which is then used as a metric to gauge the completeness of roads mapped in each local authority. Since OSM goes into greater detail, such as footpaths, cycle lanes and green spaces (which other maps usually do not include), a high score here does not mean that OSM is complete in that area. Although, low and high scores do tend to correlate to how complete OSM is in that region.
